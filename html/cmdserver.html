<h1>Command Server</h1>
The command server feature allows external programs to 
control splot. You could, for example, send commands
to splot from a macro in a spec application.

Many commands are already integrated in the splot_cntl()
function in spec. 

Look for full list of supported commands and communication
protocol in the splot documentation set.
